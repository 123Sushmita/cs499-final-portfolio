  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Hi everyone, my name is Sushmita Dhital, and I'm pleased to share my final portfolio for Southern New Hampshire University's CS 499 Computer Science Capstone. I‚Äôm graduating on May, 2025. This professional evaluation reflects my academic background, academic skills, accomplishments, and preparedness for my career growth in computer science and software development. Now I have solid technical knowledge, useful coding abilities, efficient knowledge and skills, a better comprehension of how technology affects our surroundings thanks to this curriculum.
  </p>

  <h3>Academic and Professional Goals</h3>
  <p>
    The primary goal was to build foundation in computer science and excel my skills to have a career in software development. I wanted to solve real world problems, have a hands-on experience, use real world applications, grow into a confident professionally as well. Gradually, I developed my interested-on software engineering and algorithm design.<br><br>
    Now, my goal is to secure software developer or QA engineer where I can excel my knowledge and have an experience in real world experience. In long term planning to be software developer and leading a team, contributing to large scale software and mentoring others in the fields.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on Core Domains</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Software Design and Engineering:</strong> Applying object-oriented design concepts, adhering to design patterns, and developing scalable software were my key goals in this field. My Artifact 1 shows how to employ improved software design and architectural documentation. Planning and documentation are crucial to the software development life cycle, I discovered.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong> This was among the most thought-provoking fields. I gained knowledge on how to use effective solutions and assess the time and space complexities of algorithms. Enhancements in algorithm performance and the application of suitable data structures to handle a problem more effectively are demonstrated in my Artifact 2.</li>
    <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Here, the main emphasis was on database architecture, normalization, and crafting intricate SQL queries. I improved a project in Artifact 3 to increase database security and efficiency. I used relationships, CRUD operations, and schema validation, all of which are essential for backend development.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> A few of my classes included security. I learnt how to encrypt data and establish authentication and permission in online apps. I now include understanding secure coding standards in my development process.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing and Validation:</strong> Early and frequent software testing taught me the importance of it. I used unit testing, integration testing, and test automation to assure dependability and minimize problems. I now understand how checking saves time and increases trust in my code, and it has become a necessary habit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Artifacts Reflection</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Artifact 1 (Software Engineering):</strong> Shows my understanding of code organization, modularity, and software architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>Artifact 2 (Algorithms & Data Structures):</strong> Demonstrates algorithm analysis and improvements to optimize performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Artifact 3 (Databases):</strong> Reflects my database management and ability to work with SQL and secure data handling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Professionalism and Ethics</h3>
  <p>
    Through different classes and discussions, I discovered that ethical responsibility is crucial to a computing professional's work. Whether it's protecting data privacy, preserving code integrity, or creating inclusive software, I endeavor to be a responsible and ethical developer. I will continue to approach the industry with this perspective.
  </p>

  <h3>Lifelong Learning Achievement</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Online resources such as edX, Udemy, and Coursera</li>
    <li>Obtaining certifications in front-end frameworks, security, or cloud computing</li>
    <li>Participating in open-source initiatives</li>
    <li>Participating in all conferences, webinars, tech meetups and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    SNHU's computer science curriculum has equipped me with the skills, and I was able to excel my technical knowledge and skills that I need to enter the workforce with assurance. From a student to a developer, I've developed both my coding skills and my understanding of the wider implications of technology which will play vital role in my life, and I will be gaining good experience in real world experience as well. I'm excited to begin the next chapter in my career and I‚Äôm extremely proud of all I've learned and achieved along the way.
